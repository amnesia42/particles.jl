understand the setting of the drifter experiment
understand the two-step iteration: balanced newton-second law and the effect of random drifter
	the effect of diffusion displace itself in the diffusion coefficient
establish project environment in the root directory of the project and start working in the sub-directory
program 
to-do-list: 
	keep playing around with the code; 
	know more about how to make updates with the normally distributed displacement;
	read other reports;
Attention:
	find out the points to improve in the reports; 

22.11.03
Discuss N. Scheijen's bachelor thesis; under the equivalence of advection-diffusion equ and the Fokker-Planck equ
Get to know sth about lock exchange flow.

I played around the code "run_simulation.jl" and fixed many bugs, environment variable, parse arguments using commandline, solving the problem of importing a julia package. I also learnt how to read and write NetCDF file using Julia. 
Attention
Keep on learning about Julia basics, especially how to manipulate arrays and some othe features.
	follow the github page and also the course on Julia website.

to-do-list:
	adapt N. Scheijen's code to 3D test case
	collect data about lock exchange flow

22.11.11
reproduce the result about eddy velocity field in Nelleke's work

H=50, L=2H; c=d=pi/50

22.11.24
visualiazaition; track similar particles as Nelleke did 
visualize the 3D flow field; formulate the whole 3D problem
